# Indrio Fields: World-Class Farm-to-Table Intelligence Platform

## The Vision

**Indrio Fields is the S&P Global of food quality.**

Not a store. Not a catalog. A trusted authority that helps people navigate the broken food system with confidence. The brands (Hale Groves, Pittman & Davis, Everglades Ranch) exist as **proof points**—examples of what quality looks like when you apply the framework.

### The One-Liner
> "We measure what labels only promise."

## Page-by-Page Purpose

### HOME
**Purpose:** Establish authority, hook with the problem, invite deeper exploration.

**NOT:** "Buy our citrus"
**IS:** "You've noticed food doesn't taste like it used to. You're not crazy. Here's what's actually going on—and what you can do about it."

**Key elements:**
- Problem statement (the food system is broken)
- The promise (we measure what labels only promise)
- Three paths: Learn / Verify / Shop
- Featured content (latest article, comparison report)
- Newsletter signup
- Social proof (but credibility, not sales testimonials)

### LEARN
**Purpose:** Become the trusted educational resource on food quality.

**Depth matters.** This isn't marketing fluff—it's substantive content that actually teaches. Someone should be able to spend hours learning here.

**Key content types:**
- **Explainers**: What is brix? How do omega ratios work?
- **Guides**: Complete guide to buying beef, citrus buying guide
- **Definitions**: The 36+ agricultural terms from Fielder, explained plainly
- **Myth busters**: "Organic is always healthier" (it's complicated)

### FIELDER
**Purpose:** The verification engine. This is where the proprietary value lives.

**Key features:**
- **Quality scores**: How we rate products and farms
- **Comparison library**: Side-by-side quality data
- **Cultivar database**: Deep data on varieties, brix ranges, seasons
- **Farm discovery**: Find verified quality near you

**The "Same Label, Different Nutrition" play:**
Buy competitor products, test them, publish results. Legal, viral, devastating.

### CONTENT
**Purpose:** Alex's voice. The ongoing conversation.

**Content strategy:**
- News intelligence → Alex's take
- Deep educational dives
- Myth busters
- Comparison reports
- Newsletter archive

### SHOP
**Purpose:** Proof that this framework produces results.

**Key reframe:** The brands aren't the product—**they're case studies**.

"Here's what happens when you apply SHARE principles. Here's what 11° brix citrus tastes like. Here's what 6:1 omega beef looks like. Want to experience it? These are the brands we built."

## Quality Tiers (From Fielder)

This classification system should be visible throughout the site:

| Tier | Brix Range | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Artisan** | 14-18° | Exceptional—boutique producers, meticulous practices |
| **Premium** | 12-15° | Heritage varieties bred for flavor and nutrition |
| **Standard** | 10-12° | Modern commercial with balanced traits |
| **Commodity** | 8-10° | Bred for yield and shipping—grocery store default |

**Our brands operate at Premium tier minimum. Grocery is Commodity tier.**

---

## Omega Ratio Classifications (From Fielder)

| Ratio | Classification | What It Means |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| ≤3:1 | Exceptional | True 100% grass-fed, anti-inflammatory |
| 3-6:1 | Premium | Good grass-finished (Everglades Ranch: 6:1) |
| 6-12:1 | Standard | Mixed feeding regime |
| >12:1 | Commodity | Feedlot/grain-fed, pro-inflammatory |
| 15-20:1 | Feedlot | Industry standard CAFO |
| 20-26:1 | Premium CAFO | Extended grain finishing (Wagyu, Prime) |

---

## Content From Fielder to Surface

### Agricultural Definitions (36+ terms)
The Fielder project has deep definitions for terms like:
- Organic (what it actually means legally)
- Grass-fed vs Grass-finished
- Pasture-raised (the loopholes)
- Product of USA (the fraud)
- Heritage vs Heirloom
- Climacteric vs Non-climacteric
- And many more...

**These become the glossary/definitions section.**

### Cultivar Database
Fielder has research-backed data on cultivars:
- Washington Navel: peak 12.5°, avg 11.5°, range 10.5-13.0°
- Cara Cara: peak 13.0°, avg 12.0°, range 11.0-14.0°
- Rio Red Grapefruit: peak 11.0°, avg 10.0°
- And more...

**This becomes the cultivar database/guides.**

### SHARE Scoring Methodology
The full SHARE framework with:
- Soil health scoring
- Heritage/genetics impact
- Agricultural practice modifiers
- Ripening/timing calculations
- Enrichment verification

**This becomes the methodology page.**

### Claim Inference Engine
The Fielder claim analysis for beef:
- What "grass-fed" alone means (likely grain-finished)
- What silence signals (no CAFO claim = assume CAFO)
- The marketing vs reality gap

**This becomes comparison content and buyer guides.**

## The Competitive Moat

| Asset | Why It's Defensible |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Data moat** | Prediction→measurement pairs can't be synthesized by AI |
| **SHARE framework** | Proprietary, research-backed methodology |
| **Cultivar database** | Deep research data on varieties |
| **Comparison library** | Actual lab tests on competitors |
| **Content engine** | Alex's voice, informed by Library RAG |
| **First-mover** | No one else measures outcomes at scale |

### 4. Design Excellence
- Clean, authoritative aesthetic
- Data visualization done right
- Mobile-first
- Fast performance
- Accessible

### 5. Trust Signals

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Sprint)
- [ ] Restructure site architecture
- [ ] Rewrite homepage as guide, not sales funnel
- [ ] Create LEARN section with core educational content

- [ ] Move brands to SHOP section as proof points

### Phase 2: Content Depth
- [ ] Port agricultural definitions from Fielder
- [ ] Create cultivar database pages
- [ ] Write category guides (citrus, beef)
- [ ] Build comparison library structure

### Phase 3: Tools
- [ ] Quality score lookup tool
- [ ] What's in season calculator
- [ ] Farm discovery (if data available)
- [ ] Newsletter archive

### Phase 4: Fielder Integration
- [ ] API connection to Fielder engine
- [ ] Dynamic quality scores
- [ ] Harvest window predictions
- [ ] Flavor App landing page

## Success Metrics

**Authority indicators:**
- Time on site (people learning, not bouncing)
- Pages per session (exploring depth)
- Return visitors (coming back for more)
- Newsletter signups (building relationship)
- Social shares of educational content

**NOT primary metrics:**
- Direct sales (that's what brand sites are for)
- Conversion rate (we're not optimizing for transactions)

---

## The Positioning Statement

**For** health-conscious consumers who care about food quality

**Who** are frustrated by misleading labels and declining nutrition

**Indrio Fields** is the trusted guide to farm-to-table food quality

**That** measures what labels only promise

**Unlike** grocery stores, certifications, and marketing claims

**We** verify quality with data, not stories.

*This document defines the vision. Implementation requires restructuring the current site from a sales funnel to a platform.*
