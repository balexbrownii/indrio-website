## HERO SECTION

### Headline
We're on a mission to fix food.

### Subheadline
Not with gimmicks. Not with marketing. With direct relationships, measurable quality, and a commitment to American farmers.

## SECTION 1: THE MISSION

### Full Mission Statement (Large Text)
> "Connecting people to superior flavor and nutrition to benefit their health—all while preserving farmland in the USA. That's to help farmers, ranchers, growers, and makers here who are having to compete against industrial foods, imported foods, and regulations that undercut them."

## SECTION 2: THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN

### Headline
Why this matters

### Problem 1: Consolidation Creates Risk

**The numbers:**
- 4 companies control 85% of beef processing in America
- A single plant can process millions of pounds per week
- When one plant fails, the ripple effects are massive

**The reality:**
Food recalls are getting deadlier because the system is getting more concentrated. When a small producer has a problem, a few hundred people might be affected. When a mega-processor has a problem, it's a nationwide crisis.

Recalls aren't accidents. They're the inevitable result of a system that optimized for scale over safety.

### Problem 2: Import Deception

**The loophole:**
Under current labeling rules, beef can be imported from anywhere in the world, processed in a U.S. facility, and labeled "Product of USA."

**What this means:**
That "American beef" in your grocery store? It might have been raised in Brazil, shipped frozen across the ocean, and merely cut and packaged here. Legally labeled American.

The rancher down the road raising cattle on pasture? He's competing against this. And losing.

### Problem 3: Labeling Fraud

**"Grass-fed" doesn't mean what you think:**
Animals can be raised on grain for most of their lives and still qualify for grass-fed labels if they're "finished" on grass for a few weeks.

**"Pasture-raised" is even worse:**
Many "pasture-raised" operations meet the minimum legal standard: access to outdoors. Not actual time on pasture. Access.

**"Organic" has its own problems:**
Legitimate organic farmers are being undercut by fraudulent imports that get the certification without following the practices.

### Problem 4: Quality Nobody Measures

**The grocery store model:**
Pick the cheapest supplier. Move the most volume. Quality is whatever arrives.

Nobody measures the sugar content of oranges. Nobody tracks the omega ratios in beef. Nobody knows—or cares—whether the food is actually good.

**The result:**
Produce bred for shipping durability, not flavor. Livestock raised for speed, not nutrition. A race to the bottom that customers pay for in mediocrity.

## SECTION 3: OUR ANSWER

### Headline
What we do differently

### Direct Relationships
We work directly with farmers, ranchers, and growers. No commodity markets. No anonymous supply chains. We know where every piece of food comes from, and we pay fairly for quality.

### Measurable Standards
We don't just say our food is better. We measure it.

- **Citrus**: Brix (sugar content) tested at harvest. Our minimum: 11°. Grocery average: 6-8°.
- **Beef**: Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio tracked. Our standard: 3:1 or better. Feedlot average: 20:1.

If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't ship.

### Verification, Not Marketing
We're building Fielder—a quality verification system that measures what actually matters. Not certifications. Not labels. Actual food quality data.

When competitors are better, we'll say so. When they're not, we'll show the receipts.

### S.H.A.R.E. Framework
Our quality principles:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Soil** | Healthy soil produces healthy food |
| **Heritage** | Varieties for flavor, not shipping |
| **Agricultural** | Minimal synthetic inputs |
| **Ripening** | Harvested at peak maturity |
| **Enriching** | Benefits the entire ecosystem |

## SECTION 4: WHAT WE BELIEVE

### Headline
Our beliefs

### Belief Statements (Use as bullet points or cards)

**American farmers deserve a fair market.**
They're competing against imports, industrial operations, and regulations written by lobbyists. We're building an alternative.

**Food quality should be measurable, not marketing.**
If you can't put a number on it, it's just a story. We measure what matters.

**Small scale means lower risk and higher quality.**
When one farm has a problem, a few people are affected. When a mega-processor has a problem, it's a national crisis. Scale is a liability dressed up as efficiency.

**You deserve to know where your food comes from.**
Not "Product of USA" printed on a label. Actually know. The farm. The farmer. The practices.

**Regulations should protect farmers, not just the biggest players.**
Current rules favor scale. We think that's backwards.
