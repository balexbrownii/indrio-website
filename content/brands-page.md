## SECTION: BRAND CARDS

### Hale Groves

**Logo**: [Hale Groves logo]

**Category**: Premium Citrus

**Description**:
Indian River citrus from Florida's legendary growing region. Family-owned since 1947, acquired by Indrio in 2006. We ship tree-ripened fruit directly to your door—never picked green, never sitting in cold storage.

**Quality Standard**:
**11° Brix minimum** — That's sugar content. Grocery store oranges average 8-10° (commodity tier). Ours start above their best.

### Pittman & Davis

**Logo**: [Pittman & Davis logo]

**Category**: Texas Citrus & Specialty Foods

**Description**:
Texas Ruby Red grapefruit and specialty foods since the 1920s. Acquired by Indrio in 2008. Known for gift boxes that actually impress—because the fruit inside is worth opening.

**Quality Standard**:
**Hand-selected, tree-ripened** — Every piece of fruit is touched by human hands, not just machines sorting by size.

Fresh-squeezed orange juice and lemonade from our Fort Myers location. Founded 1990, acquired by Indrio in 2020. We squeeze it the same day you drink it. No pasteurization. No concentrate. No shelf-stable compromises.

**Quality Standard**:

### Everglades Ranch

**Logo**: [Everglades Ranch logo]

**Category**: Grass-Fed Beef

**Description**:
100% grass-fed, grass-finished beef from Florida pastures. No feedlots. No grain finishing. No "grass-fed" loopholes. The way beef was raised before industrial agriculture decided cattle should eat corn.

**Quality Standard**:
**2.5:1 omega-6 to omega-3 ratio** — Feedlot beef runs 15-20:1. This matters for inflammation, heart health, and how your body processes the fat.

## SECTION: WHY IT MATTERS

### Headline
Why we measure quality

### Body Copy
Most food companies use words like "premium" and "quality" without any data to back it up. It's marketing.

We think differently.

**Brix** measures sugar content in citrus. Higher Brix = sweeter, more flavorful fruit. We test every harvest and reject anything below our minimum.

**Omega ratios** measure the fatty acid balance in beef. Grass-fed animals have healthier ratios than grain-fed. We track this because it matters for your health.

These aren't just numbers. They're the difference between food that nourishes and food that merely fills.

## SECTION: NOT SHOWN (Note for Alex)

**Removed from this page** (but may still exist on separate pages or backend):

- **Hoorag** (outdoor apparel) — Doesn't fit the food mission. Keep the brand, just don't feature it on the main Indrio site.
- **Yarden** (plants/trees) — Same reasoning. Good business, different story.
- **Southern Fulfillment Services** (3PL logistics) — B2B operation. Doesn't need consumer-facing presence on the brand page.

These can have their own sites and businesses. They just don't belong in the "food mission" narrative.
