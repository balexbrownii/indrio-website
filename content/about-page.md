## SECTION 1: ALEX'S STORY

### Story (First Person Voice)
I've been in the citrus business for over 20 years. Started working in my family's groves as a teenager. Went to law school, got an MBA, and still came back to fruit.

Here's what I learned: the food system is broken, and most people don't know it.

Walk into any grocery store. The produce section looks beautiful. But that orange in your hand? You have no idea if it's any good. Neither does the store. They're gambling—and so are you.

I watched this happen over decades. Varieties bred for shipping, not eating. Fruit picked green so it could survive a two-week journey. Growers squeezed on price until only the biggest operations could survive.

Meanwhile, the consolidation kept accelerating. Four companies now control 85% of beef processing. A handful of operations dominate citrus. When something goes wrong at scale, millions of people are affected.

**That's not efficiency. That's fragility dressed up as progress.**

We started Indrio to build something different. Direct relationships with farmers and ranchers who do it right. Measurable quality standards—not marketing claims, actual data. A path that cuts out the middlemen and connects you directly to the source.

This isn't a side project or a marketing angle. It's what I've spent my career building toward.

### Credentials (Optional sidebar or below)
- 20+ years in agriculture and direct-to-consumer food

## SECTION 2: THE FAMILY

### Headline
A family business

### Body Copy
Indrio was founded in 2006 by brothers Alex and Rollins Brown. What started with Hale Groves—a historic Indian River citrus company—has grown into a portfolio of brands united by a common mission.

We're still family-owned. We still make decisions based on what's right, not what's fastest. And we still believe that American farmers deserve a fair market.

## SECTION 3: KEY TEAM (Optional - Can Simplify)

If you want to keep some leadership visibility:

### Rollins Brown
**Co-Founder**
Former law enforcement officer turned commercial lawyer. Handles legal and business development. Co-founded Citrus.com and Southern Fulfillment Services.

### [Other Key Leaders]
Keep brief. 1-2 sentences each. Focus on relevant experience, not corporate resume.

**Note**: You might simplify this to just Alex + "our team" without individual bios. The mission is more important than the org chart.
