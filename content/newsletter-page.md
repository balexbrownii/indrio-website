## SECTION: WHAT TO EXPECT

### Headline
What you'll get

### Content Cards or List

**Current Events, Farmer's Perspective**
When a food recall makes headlines, you'll get the context the news doesn't provide. When policy changes, you'll understand what it actually means for your food.

**Data and Science, Not Marketing**
We back up what we say. Research citations. Actual numbers. The receipts.

**Contrarian Takes**
The food industry tells a comfortable story. We tell the truth—even when it's inconvenient.

**5 Minutes, Once a Week**
Short enough to read with your morning coffee. Substantive enough to change how you think about food.
