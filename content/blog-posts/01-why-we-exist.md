## The Post

I've been in the food business for over 20 years. Citrus, mostly. Started in the family groves as a teenager. Went to law school, got an MBA, and still came back to fruit.

You'd think after two decades I'd have figured out how to play the game. Get big. Cut costs. Optimize for volume. That's what wins in this industry.

But here's what I can't stop thinking about: **the food system is broken**, and most people have no idea.

### The Casino You Walk Into Every Week

Walk into any grocery store. The produce section looks beautiful. Neat rows. Perfect lighting. Everything arranged to make you feel like you're making good choices.

Now pick up an orange.

What do you actually know about it?

You don't know when it was picked. You don't know how sweet it is. You don't know if it was bred for flavor or for surviving a two-week truck ride across the country.

The store doesn't know either. Neither does the distributor. Neither does the importer.

**You're gambling.** Sometimes you get a good one. Sometimes you don't. The house always wins—you keep coming back hoping this time will be different.

### The Concentration Problem

Four companies control 85% of beef processing in America. Four.

A single processing plant can handle millions of pounds per week. That sounds efficient until something goes wrong.

When something goes wrong at that scale, it's not a local problem. It's a national crisis. Millions of pounds recalled. Dozens sick. Sometimes people die.

**Recalls aren't accidents.** They're the inevitable result of a system that optimized for scale over safety. The consolidation that made food cheaper also made it more fragile.

This is what efficiency looks like when nobody's measuring the right things.

### The Import Deception

Here's a fun fact: beef can be imported from Brazil, processed in a U.S. facility, and legally labeled "Product of USA."

Not "processed in USA." **Product of USA.**

The rancher down the road—the one raising cattle on pasture, the one investing in the land, the one whose family has been here for generations—he's competing against this. And losing.

The regulations that were supposed to protect consumers ended up protecting the biggest players. The ones with lawyers. The ones who know how to game the system.

### What We're Building

I started Indrio because I couldn't keep watching this happen.

We're building something different:

**Direct relationships with farmers, ranchers, and growers.** Not commodity markets. Not anonymous supply chains. We know where every piece of food comes from, and we pay fairly for quality.

**Measurable standards.** We test the sugar content of our citrus. We track the omega ratios in our beef. If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't ship. Not "premium quality" marketing—actual data.

**A path that cuts out the middlemen.** When you buy from us, you're not gambling. You're getting food that meets a floor. Every time.

### Why This Matters

This isn't about selling fruit. It's about building a different food system.

American farmers are getting squeezed out. Consolidation is making food more fragile. Quality is being defined by lawyers instead of farmers.

We can't fix all of it. But we can build an alternative. One customer, one farm, one shipment at a time.

If you're tired of gambling at the grocery store, we're building something for you.

If you believe American farmers deserve a fair market, we're building something for you.

If you think food quality should be measurable instead of marketable, we're building something for you.

That's why we exist.
