# Indrio Fields Website - Content Audit

**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Issue:** Content feels redundant and flat across pages

---

## Executive Summary

The current site has strong core messaging but suffers from:
1. **Repetition** - Same phrases appear 4-6 times across pages
2. **Flat structure** - Every page restates the basics instead of deepening
3. **Missing depth** - Core differentiators aren't fully explained
4. **No progression** - Visitor learns the same thing on every page

---

## Redundancy Analysis

### Repeated Phrases (Tracked by Page)

| Phrase/Concept | Home | Mission | Brands | About | Blog | Newsletter |
|----------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|:----:|:----------:|
| "Food system is broken" | ✓ | ✓ | | | ✓ | |
| "Grown to look good, not do good" | ✓ | | | | | |
| "Family farmers 200+ years" | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ |
| S.H.A.R.E. framework | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | |
| "Don't blame the farmers" | ✓ | ✓ | | | ✓ | |
| "Paid for what truly matters" | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| "Measure what matters" / "just marketing" | | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| "Grow Different. Eat Better. Fix the Food System." | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ |
| "No middlemen" / "direct connection" | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | |

**Result:** A visitor clicking through the site reads the same 8-10 talking points 3-4 times.

## Page-by-Page Issues

### Homepage
**Current:** Good structure, but tries to cover everything
**Problem:** S.H.A.R.E., brands, blog preview, mission—all surface-level
**Should Be:** The "trailer"—hook them, don't tell them everything

### Mission Page
**Current:** Restates homepage content with slight expansion
**Problem:** Reads like extended homepage, not a deep dive
**Missing:**
- Specific examples of "broken system" (USDA grading rules, grocery economics)
- Named adversaries (commodity markets, middlemen structures)
- Concrete outcomes of current system

### Brands Page
**Current:** Good brand details, but S.H.A.R.E. callout redundant
**Problem:** "Different products. Same standards" doesn't differentiate brands
**Missing:**
- Each brand's unique story/origin
- Why we own THESE brands specifically
- How brands complement each other

### About Page
**Current:** Strongest content—actual story, actual history
**Problem:** Still has redundant "What Indrio Fields Is" section
**Fix:** Lean into the narrative, cut the list-style content

### Blog Page
**Current:** Good placeholder structure
**Problem:** Just listing posts, no editorial voice
**Missing:** Editor's note, content series, topic areas

### Newsletter Page
**Current:** Best voice—feels like Alex talking
**Problem:** Slight redundancy in "what you'll learn"
**Fix:** Keep the personal voice, trim duplicates

## What's Missing (Depth Not Present)

### 1. **The Broken System - Specifics**
Current site says "the system is broken" but doesn't explain HOW:
- USDA grading standards (appearance-focused)
- Grocery chain economics (volume over quality)
- Commodity pricing (farmers paid by bushel, not brix)
- Cold chain logistics (picked unripe to survive shipping)

### 2. **S.H.A.R.E. Framework - The Science**
Current: One-sentence per letter
Missing:
- **Soil**: What specifically? Microbiome? Cover crops? No-till? How do you measure soil health?
- **Heritage**: Which varieties? Why did industry abandon them? Examples?
- **Agricultural**: "Minimal synthetic inputs"—what does that mean? What DO you use?
- **Ripen**: How do you know when? What happens if you pick too early?
- **Enrich**: How much more do you pay farmers? What's the premium?

### 3. **Fielder Quality Verification**
Referenced in project docs but NOT on website:
- How quality is measured
- Brix testing methodology
- Lab partnerships
- Comparison data vs grocery
- Third-party verification

### 4. **Partner Network**
Site says "we partner with farms, ranches, and makers"
Missing:
- Who are they?
- Where are they?
- How do you select them?
- Map or directory

### 5. **Impact & Scale**
No concrete metrics:
- Acres of farmland preserved
- Families served
- Farmers in network
- Years of combined experience

### 6. **Transparency/Traceability**
Competitors (Vital Farms) have QR codes to farm videos
Missing:
- "Where's my food from" feature
- Farm profiles
- Lot traceability

## Proposed Content Architecture

### Principle: Each page has ONE job

```
HOME
├── Job: Hook them, show range, get them deeper
├── Content: One powerful statement + S.H.A.R.E. teaser + brand tiles + featured post
└── NO: Full framework explanation, full brand stories

WHY WE EXIST (Mission)
├── Job: Full manifesto, the problem in detail
├── Content: The broken system (specifics), our response, the vision
└── NO: S.H.A.R.E. details, brand mentions

HOW WE GROW (New page - The Method)
├── Job: Deep dive on S.H.A.R.E. and quality verification
├── Content: Each principle explained, Fielder data, testing methodology
└── NO: Origin story, brand details

OUR BRANDS
├── Job: Individual brand stories + shop links
├── Content: Origin of each brand, what makes it unique, products
└── NO: Shared framework (link to How We Grow instead)

OUR FARMERS (New page)
├── Job: Human connection, network visibility
├── Content: Farmer profiles, partner map, selection criteria
└── NO: Duplicating mission/method content

ABOUT
├── Job: Alex's story, the family, the name
├── Content: Origin narrative, leadership, "Why Indrio"
└── NO: Framework, beliefs (those have their own pages)

FROM THE FIELD (Blog)
├── Job: Proof and education
├── Content: Deep dives, explainers, seasonal updates
└── Organize by: Topic series, not just chronological

THE FIELD GUIDE (Newsletter)
├── Job: Personal connection, signup
├── Content: Alex's voice, sample issues, FAQ
└── Keep as is—this page works
```

## Content Principles (Going Forward)

### 1. Say It Once, Say It Best
Choose ONE place for each major concept:
- "Broken system" → Mission page (deep dive)
- S.H.A.R.E. framework → How We Grow page (full detail)
- Family history → About page (narrative)
- Quality metrics → How We Grow / Fielder section

### 2. Link, Don't Repeat
Instead of re-explaining S.H.A.R.E. on Brands page:
> "Every brand meets our S.H.A.R.E. standards. [Learn how we grow →]"

### 3. Progress the Visitor
Homepage → Hook
Mission → Convince (WHY)
How We Grow → Prove (HOW)
Brands → Enable (WHAT to buy)

### 4. Earn Depth Through Navigation
Don't front-load everything. Let curious visitors discover more.

## Priority Rewrites

### Immediate
1. **Homepage**: Trim S.H.A.R.E. to teaser + link
2. **Mission**: Remove S.H.A.R.E. details, add broken system specifics
3. **Brands**: Remove S.H.A.R.E. callout box, add brand origin stories

### Soon
4. **New page: How We Grow**: Move S.H.A.R.E. deep dive here, add Fielder
5. **New page: Our Farmers**: Partner profiles, network map

### Later
6. **Blog**: Add editorial structure (series, topics)
7. **Fielder integration**: Comparison tool, quality dashboard

---

## Sample Rewrites

### Homepage Hero (Tighter)
**Current:**
> Most food is grown to look good. Not do good.
> We grow and connect food that's truly better—flavorful, nourishing, American-grown.
> This is how we change the food system from the ground up.

**Revised:**
> Most food is grown to look good. Not do good.
> We're family farmers building a better system—one where nutrition and flavor actually matter.

(Move the "how" to dedicated page)

### S.H.A.R.E. on Homepage (Teaser Only)
**Current:** Full 5-card grid with descriptions
**Revised:** One line + link
> Our S.H.A.R.E. framework defines what quality means—from soil health to farmer economics. [See how we grow →]

### Mission Page Opening (Add Specificity)
**Current:**
> The food system is broken. It rewards yield and appearance—not nutrition or flavor.

**Revised:**
> The food system rewards the wrong things.
>
> USDA grades citrus by peel color, not sugar content. Grocers pay by the pound, not the brix. Farmers are forced to pick unripe so fruit survives a 2,000-mile cold chain.
>
> The result? Perfect-looking produce that tastes like nothing.

(Now the reader understands SPECIFICALLY what's broken)
